# 🧠 AI & ML Internship - Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Objective
The goal of this task is to **understand the dataset** using statistics and visualizations.  
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) helps to:
- Identify patterns and trends
- Detect missing values and outliers
- Understand relationships between features
- Gain insights for further modeling

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- **Python**
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation
- **NumPy** – Numerical computations
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization
- **Plotly** – Interactive visualizations

---

## 📂 Steps Performed
1. **Data Loading**
   - Loaded the Titanic dataset from an online source.
2. **Data Exploration**
   - Checked shape, data types, and missing values.
3. **Summary Statistics**
   - Mean, median, standard deviation, skewness.
4. **Data Visualization**
   - Histograms & Boxplots for numeric features.
   - Correlation heatmap & Pairplots.
5. **Feature Analysis**
   - Detected skewness and multicollinearity.
   - Explored patterns in survival rates by Gender and Class.

---

## 📊 Sample Visualizations
- Histogram of Age & Fare
- Boxplot for Age (Outlier detection)
- Heatmap of feature correlations
- Pairplot of Age, Fare, and Survival
- Barplots: Survival by Gender and Class

---

## 📌 Insights
- Higher survival rate for **females** and **1st class passengers**.
- **Fare** shows a strong skewness; may require log transformation for modeling.
- **Age** has outliers that can be handled in preprocessing.
